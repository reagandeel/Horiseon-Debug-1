## Description

In this project, I aimed to correct the div tags with semantic HTML elements and provide a better structure for the webpage.
In doing this, I needed to correct the CSS Style sheet to correct any corresponding CSS commands.


## Installation

I replaced the div tags on each section with semantic HTML elements such as nav, element, section, header, aside, and footer. I consolidated the CSS to make it more concise. Each image was provided with an "alt" description.
